# CheatVault.io Landing Page

## Overview
A ultra-premium, cinematic landing page for "CheatVault.io" with a dark luxury aesthetic inspired by high-end gaming culture. The design combines deep blacks, liquid gold accents, holographic effects, and glassmorphism to create a visually striking single-page experience.

## Design System
- **Background**: Deep void black (#050505) with subtle CSS film grain noise overlay
- **Primary Accent**: Liquid Gold gradient (#D4AF37 → #FFD700) for CTAs and branding
- **Secondary Accent**: Holographic Diamond (Cyan → Purple) for hover effects and subtle borders
- **Glass UI**: All containers use heavy backdrop blur, ultra-low opacity fills, and barely-visible borders
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts — **Space Grotesk** (headings, bold, tight tracking) + **Inter** (body text)

## Layout & Sections

### 1. Floating Navbar
- Fixed at top with glass effect, slightly inset from edges
- Logo "CheatVault" rendered in the gold gradient on the left
